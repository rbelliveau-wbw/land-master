# Contracts Module

## New contract and lot-picker presentation (1.57.1)

New Contract is the enlarged main modal title; the redundant Create Contract heading is removed. New-contract dropdowns use white backgrounds and visible borders. Choose lots builds its subdivision choices from the contract selection and resolves names from loaded Subdivision records, then lot lookup display names, including when there are no lots. Async loads repaint the custom combo rather than inserting native option elements into its button. Existing Subdivision.Subdivision_Name and lot subdivision lookups are read only; no fields, functions, Custom APIs, or Creator deployment changes. Regression checks cover no lots, ID-only lookup, display-name fallback, missing names, and allowed-subdivision scope; also verify contract creation, dropdown selection, and Choose lots after loading. Rollback: `1.57.0`.

## Scope

Contracts, contract versions, schedules/actions, approvals, attachments, and LOI legal review.

## LOI review

The current contract widget supports token-based legal review using `tokenId`. Preserve token validation, review status, legal note, and Proforma/Contract linkage.

## Attachments

`Contract_Version` is also used by Budget attachments. Confirm the correct parent lookup (`Contract1` versus `Budget`) before changing shared attachment logic.

Contracts use one `Contract_Version` record per file with `Contract1` as the
parent lookup and `File_field1` as the upload field. Attachment record creation,
deletion, and exact-byte reads use these Custom APIs first:

- `Create_Contract_Attachment_Record` → `createContractAttachmentRecord`
- `Delete_Contract_Attachment` → `deleteContractAttachment`
- `Get_Contract_Attachment_Preview` → `getContractAttachmentPreview`

`Get_Contract_Attachment_Preview` supplies the same base64 bytes to both the
in-widget preview and download paths. The function must verify both the
`Contract_Version.ID` and `Contract1` parent before returning a file.
